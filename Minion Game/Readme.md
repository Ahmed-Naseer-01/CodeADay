  <h1>Minion Game</h1>
  <p>This is a Python program that implements the Minion Game, based on the popular animated movie "Despicable Me". The objective of the game is to determine which player, Stuart or Kevin, can form more substrings from the given string, which in this case is "BANANA". The game is played in turns where each player selects a letter from the string and either forms a substring with it or adds it to their list of previously selected letters. Points are awarded for each valid substring formed and the game ends when all possible substrings have been formed.</p>
  <p>The program prompts the user to input their selected letter and substring and checks for valid inputs before awarding points to the respective player. At the end of the game, the program declares the winner based on their respective scores or declares a draw in case of a tie.</p>
